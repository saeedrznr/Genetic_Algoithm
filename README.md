# Genetic_Algoithm
a python program thart uses genetic algorithm to find max point of   y  = sin(10pi*x)+2

This project has two files named basic.py and advanced.py, both of which use the genetic algorithm to find the maximum graph. The difference is that basic.py generates generations 100 times, but advanced.py It continues the generation process until 5 consecutive generations of the obtained answers are worse than the previous answers.
The order of the steps of the algorithm is as follows:
Selection
crossover
mutation
